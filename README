This is the Github for the IEEE's FDA project. This README is to be used as a simple discription of what we intend to accomplish. 

Our aim is to build a fully functioning program that can be used as a replacement for CNU's FDA check-in/out system. Our program will be a standalone .exe witch can run on any FDA's computer. Our end goal is to presend our software to IT services as a viable replacement with a full write-up.
